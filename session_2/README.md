# HTTP

- client-server based architecture
  web server is serving some resources
- Request-Response model to serve resources
  Resources are indetified by URI/URL
- version - HTTP 1.0/1.1:
  1.0 one resource per connection
  the key difference is 1.1 can reuse connection for multiple URIs

- How it really works?
  client --> server --> database.

## exercise

open sudo wireshark and start captureing the eth0
open your terminal
curl -v www.google.com

the task is to identify the request parameter and response and be able to read the wireshark
and identify the three way handshake

the same host can go ahead and serves multiple domains

## Netcat

swiss army knife replacement for telnet

```bash
nc www.secutitytube.net
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: www.securitytube.net

notice that the conenction closed after the response

nc www.secutitytube.net
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: www.securitytube.net


notice that we are still connected
and we can do another request

if we want to close the connection in 1.1 after getting the response, put the
Connection: close
header
```
