# 1- Reconnaissance

## Passive Reconnaissance: what kind of iformation outthere,

from elite hackers:
The better your recon, the luckier you are to find severe bug
and it's all about recons
we look just for information

  Satellite images
  Drone Recon

  Employee (name, job, phone number, manager, etc.)
  Picture(badge photos, desk photos, computer photos)

what we do

- Web/Host Recon
  [1] Target Validation: we need to validate the target first before going any further (WHOIS, nslookup, dnsrecond)
  [2] Finding Subdomains (Google FU, dig, Nmap, Sublist3r, Bluto, crt.sh, etc)

[3] Fingerprinting :
are there any ftb port open or any protocol we can make use of?
what are the avaialbe services?

(Nmap, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, Netcat)
[4] Data Breaches (HaveIBeenPwned, Breach-Parse, WeLeakInfo)
