# 1- Reconnaissance

## Passive Reconnaissance: what kind of iformation outthere,

from elite hackers:
The better your recon, the luckier you are to find severe bug
and it's all about recons
we look just for information

- Physical/Social
  for example

- Local Information
  Satellite images
  Drone Recon
- Jon information
  Employee (name, job, phone number, manager, etc.)
  Picture(badge photos, desk photos, computer photos)

what we do

- Web/Host Recon
  [1] Target Validation: we need to validate the target first before going any further (WHOIS, nslookup, dnsrecond)
  [2] Finding Subdomains (Google FU, dig, Nmap, Sublist3r, Bluto, crt.sh, etc)

[3] Fingerprinting :
are there any ftb port open or any protocol we can make use of?
what are the avaialbe services?

(Nmap, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, Netcat)
[4] Data Breaches (HaveIBeenPwned, Breach-Parse, WeLeakInfo)

open Bugcrowd and sign in
** Stay in scope**

### Email Address

Hunter.io -> who works where and so on

## Hunting Subdomain

```bash
apt get install sublist3r
sublist3r -d tesla.com > tesla.txt
```

we can do another thing 'certificate fingerprinting` using crt.sh

there is another tool called 'amass' is very popular in bug bounty

## Identifying website technologies

builtwith website

wappalzyer => version numbers of services (any kind) is very important on enumeration phase

whatweb built-int terminal tool

why many tools?

# Google FU?

google is the most useful tool on pentesting as whole
you **Must** sharp your googling skill
-> search about google seach operators

site:tesla.com -WWW -ir filetype:csv

## Information gathering with burp

open burp
open firefox and add a proxy
open http://burp
download the cert and add it to firefox
GETting comftable with burp
proxy?
repeater?
Target?

## Utilizing the Harvester

## Utilizing social media

this step is really imporatant specially on red teaming.

# 2- Scanning and Enumeration

task -> download kioptrix level 1
you should have VMWare installed
link -> [https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/kioptrix-level-1-1,22/]

change the network settings to NAT

open your kali

```bash
ifconfig
```

what's your IP address?
fine go then do netdiscover!
let's begin
netdiscover -r <ip> -> to show the machines with you on the network
namp (network mapper)
-sS (stealth scanning) event if it says it stealthy it's not at all
nmap -sS -> the basic idea
SYN SYNACK RST
the reason why it's not
SYN SYNACK ACK -> because we don't need to actually connect to the open ports, we need to only know.

T4 (speed):the slower is the better for detection

```bash
nmap T4 -p- -A
```

p (ports): if we leave it, nmap will scan the top 1k ports

-A (scan all of it):

tip when scanning for UDP: because UDP is connectionless, so the repsonse isn't instantenous
you do

```bash
namp -sU -T4 -p <ip>
```

-sV -> show open ports
-sC -> scripit scannig
but when we use -A it does all this for all

there is caviet to use -A

the first thing should came to your mind is
what are open ports? and what are running on those ports?
look for the service and it's version number

443 and 139 are commonly found within exploits

it's not common to attack ssh

you develop your own methodology overtime

If I see a website, i go to this website and start thinking
are there any web directroies behing this?
(Direcotry Busting)

take notes as you go

nikto -> vulenrability scanning

```bash
nikto -h<host> <ip>
```

Directory busting
dirbuster
dirb
gobuster

usr/share/wordlists
use the small and for above if you found nothing it

open burpsuite and see if there's any information disclosure

-> Enumerating SMB
SMB is file share (commonly used on internal enviroment)
the type of SMB running could potentially lead to an exploit

Metasploit is an exploitation framework
we can do all kind of information gathering using auxiliray script using metasploit

```bash
mfsconsole
```

inside metasploit

```bash
search smb
```

we are looking for smb_version
use <path>
or
use <number>

type info to see what's going on?

```bash
info
```

if you need just the options, type

```bash
options
```

then use of the options to begin enumerate

```bash
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.78
```

then

```bash
run
```

as much details as we can get, this what is important
