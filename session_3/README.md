# TLS

Before Knowing TLS, we should know: <br>
[1] - Vanilla HTTP <br>
[2] - HTTPS <br>
[3] - TLS 1.2 <br>
[4] - Diffi-Helman <br>
[5] - TlS 1.3 <br>

# Encoding:

- The process of changing a sequence of charachers into a specialized format

- Commonly used for transferring data
- it is bi directional (Encoded and Decoded)

\*\* Why this needed?

- to provide a standard format for data (url encoding for example)
- Can be used for Unicode as well as ASCII

Types of Encoding:

- Base64
- Hex
- URL encoding

\*\* Base64

\*\* HEX

\*\* URL encoding

- This encoding scheme is used for the HTTP protocol in the first place
- Inside of HTTP it is used to transfer data safely
- It was invented as part of the MIME content transfer encoding

# Encryption

- Transform plaintext into ciphertext
- uses a type of Cipher
- Most Cipers use a pseudo random generated key for encryption

Why is this needed?

- used to hide sensitive data so that when intercepted cannot be viewd by anyone but the intended recipient
- not easy to crack Encryption Algorithms (happens once :"D , but not happens frequently)
- Used in large amount of systems (most websites used HTTPS which used TLS as a protocol underneath that which relies on encryption)
  Types of Enc Algo:
- RSA
- AES
- 3DES

\*\* Symmetric Enc:

- uses the same crypto key for encryption and decryption
- the key is normally shared between 2 or more end parties for encryption and decryption

-> Drawbacks

- each party member will have the same key, if one get compromised they all are compromised
- Pseudo random key generators are used for the keys and can sometimes lack randomness
  - Because of this there have been past attacks on Symmetric Encryption

\*\* Two Typed of Symmetric enc:

- Stream Cipher:  
   used to encrypt (digits and letters) one at a time in a stream
- Block Cipher:

  - takes a set number of buts and encrypt them as single entity (you are not encrypting bit a time or letter at a time, but a block at a time)
  - if the plaintext does not fit the block cipher bit size it will pad the date to make sure to fits

  - AES
  - 3DES
  - RC4

\*\* Asymmetric enc:

- Also knows as Public Key Crypto
- Used a concept of Public and Private Key's
- Public and Private Keys are generated at once as pair (so they both are bein born at the same time)
- Public Keys are sent out to 3rd parties

\*\*\* Public key: (used only for encrypting)

- Public key is public (lol xD)
- Client will use this to **encrypt** their message for the Private Key owner
- No one but the holder of the private key can decrypt a message encrypted with the Public key

\*\* Private Key:

- Private Key is kept local (Private)
- Used to decrypt the message from the Public key holder
- Should not be shared with anyone

\*\* How it works?
[1] Key Exchange

- User A generates a public and private key pai and sends the User A public key to User B
- User B genereate a public and private key pair and send the User B public key to User A
  So at the moment, they both have their own private key and they had each other public key
  [2] Establishing the Connection
- User A wants to send a message to User B
- User A encrypt the plain text message with User B's public key and sends it off to User B.
- If it is intercepted it cannot be decrypted witout User B's Private Key

- User B recieves the message and decrypts it with User B's Private Key
- User B generate its response and encrypt it with User A's public Key
- User B sends the the encrypted message to User A
- User A now decrypts it with User A's private key

Common uses:

- TLS
- RSA
- Diffie-Hellman

\*\*\* RSA

- Uses Asymmetric Encryption
- Commnly used in Hybrid Encrption (in conjunction with other encryption methods)
- Encrypts a Symmetric Encryption Key to be sent to 3rd party
- used for Digital Signature
- Used 2 very lage prime numbers and perform the Factoring Problem (Math behind RSA)

-> Drawbacks:

- it is very slow
- You would not want to use this on full connections or an entire file
- The resources required to do so would be too much for for most common systems
  \*\*\* AES

- Advanced Encryption Standard
- Utilizes a block cipher of different sizes
- common AES block sizes: - AES-128 - AES-192 - AES-256
  \*\* How It works?
- The Symmetric key length is important
- the data encrypted with the symmetric key will be encrypted over and over again depending on its size
- AES-128 will encrypt the data over 10 rounds
- AES-192 will encrypt the data over 12 rounds
- AES0-256 will encrypt the data over 14 rounds

AES commonly used in conjunction with RSA, an example of this is TLS
TLS will use Asymmetric based encryption however, it will encrypt the keys of version of RSA
